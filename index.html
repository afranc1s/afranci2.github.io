    <h1><u>Websites about Protected Areas Issues</u></h1>

    <p>Protected Areas, the topic that gets often overlooked. With the increasing and growing threat known as global
        warming, nature and ecological zones are more in need than ever. With all different kinds solutions being
        proposed by all different kinds of people, the simple solution of <b><u>"Protected Conservation Areas"</u></b>
        is often overlooked. A conservation area is an area of land, usually a forest that is protected by the
        government. It is illegal to build, alter, or impact the protected ecological zone. Not only do these zones save
        the environment, these areas are also homes to plenty of endangered animals and species. Awareness and support
        for these areas must continue to be shared.</p>
